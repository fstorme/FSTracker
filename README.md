# FSTracker 

The FSTracker collects and processes data from strava and other platforms for the amateur runner.
It offers training load tracking such as acute/chronic ratio, REDI and other state of the art methods.

# Getting Started

## Strava API
In order to get started, the first step is to set up your strava API access. There are many different tutorials like this 
[one]{https://jessicasalbert.medium.com/holding-your-hand-through-stravas-api-e642d15695f2}. 

## This repo
The next step is to clone this repo. It is still a work in progress and it is susceptible to change in time.

# Next development
 1. Training load evaluation based on Strava data
 2. Data viz app using dash
 3. Incorporate Polar/Garmin etc...
